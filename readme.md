# Adrian Kervin Portfolio

This portfolio was created mainly with the aim of showing my profile and my knowledge through the different projects that I have been doing during all this learning process. For its development, I decided to use some of the most demanded technologies such as React and Tailwind CSS as well as different libraries. This is how a fully responsive portfolio was born.
